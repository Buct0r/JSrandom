## Introducing 
# **JSrandom**
![JSrandom logo](docs/JSrandomlogo.png)
## A random password generator made with Javascript
JSrandom is a secure random password generator, built with HTML, CSS and most importantly with Javascript.

Your password will be generated in the matter of seconds after choosing the parameters you want for your password. 
* **Lenght**
* **Lowercase**
* **Uppercase**
* **Numbers**
* **Symbols**

Also you can trust JSrandom. The password you generate will never be stored somewhere

### Lenght
First of all you have the lenght of your password. You can have a password as long as one character or as long as the number of characters you want. (Just don't put too many plsüòì)

### Lowercase and uppercase
The next two parameters are used for including lowercase and uppercase characters in your password.

### Numbers and symbols
The last two parameters are used for including numbers and symbols in your password.

## Conclusion
At the moment the website will be hosted with Github Pages, but I'm already planning to buy a domain for the future. You can find it [here](https://buct0r.github.io/JSrandom/).  

# Update 1.0

With this first update I would like to introduce to you the offile version of JSrandom, made with python.

### Installation

#### Every platform
Just use the web version you can find at this [link](https://buct0r.github.io/JSrandom/)

#### Windows
Go to the [release page](https://github.com/Buct0r/JSrandom/releases), download the executable and run it. As simple as that.
You can also run the executable in the terminal, also because is a terminal application.


#### Linux
On linux you can run the .exe file with [wine](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine), a program that allows you to run windows executables on linux.
If you have it installed just navigate to the app directory and type:
```
wine JSrandom.exe
```

In alternative you can download the python file and execute it if you have python installed on your machine. You can do it in two ways:
```
python JSrandom.py
```
or 
```
python3 JSrandom.py
```

or simply use chmod to make the file executable. Add this at the top of the file and save it:
```
#!/usr/bin/python
```
then
```
chmod +x JSrandom.py
```

and then:
```
./JSrandom.py
```
# Update 2.0

This is the biggest update of JSrandom, with a new introduction page, new effects for the UI and the introduction of a copy button (finally) on the webapp, to quickly copy your passwords.

## Browser extensions
I'm also introducing the web extension of JSrandom for chromium based browsers and Firefox. For Firefox just broswe to the AMO page at this [link](https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/jsrandom/). For the chromium version, for now I can't publish it on the Chrome web store, but you can find it on the [release page](https://github.com/Buct0r/JSrandom/releases) as a zip file, that you can add to your browser enabling developer mode and uploading the zip file.

### Conclusion
Since the executable is not signed, your antivirus will probably block it. If you want you can add an exeption in your antivirus settings or if you don't trust the exe, just download the python file and run it with python. 

In the next week I will try to find a solution to add the extension to the Chrome web store.

Thanks to skesko for the collaboration with the testing phase. :3
