## A random password generator made with Javascript
JSrandom is a secure random password generator, built in HTML, CSS and most importantly in Javascript.

Your password will be generated in the matter of seconds after choosing the parameters you want for your password. 
* **Lenght**
* **Lowercase**
* **Uppercase**
* **Numbers**
* **Symbols**

Also you can trust JSrandom. The password you generate will never be stored somewhere

### Lenght
First of all you have the lenght of your password. You can have a password as long as one character or as long as the number of characters you want. (Just don't put too many plsðŸ˜“)

### Lowercase and uppercase
The next two parameters are used for including lowercase and uppercase characters in your password.

### Numbers and symbols
The last two parameters are used for including numbers and symbols in your password.

## Conclusion
For now the website will be hosted with Github Pages, but I'm already planning to buy a domain for the future. You can find it [here](https://buct0r.github.io/JSrandom/)
